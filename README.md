# GenSystem

This is a C++ console application which randomly generates a solar system.

## Functionality

TBD

## Usage

TBD.  Program is invoked from the command line once compiled.

## Future Development

Paths for future development include:

* Random appearances of Nice events.  Currently, if there was a Grand Tack, there *will* be a Nice event too.
* Habitable gas giant moons.  Currently, moons are generally too small even under favorable conditions, *and* moon details aren't worked out in depth anyway.
* Giant impact moons
* A better algorithm to determine the presence of life (currently just age)
* Orbital resonances between planets (not just moons)
* Forcing the appearance of a habitable planet ("-H command flag")

## License

This program is not currently licensed, as it is in **very** early development.
